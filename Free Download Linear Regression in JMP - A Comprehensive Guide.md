## What is Linear Regression and Why Use JMP?

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that describes how the dependent variable changes with respect to the independent variables. It allows you to predict future values, understand the strength of relationships, and identify influential factors.

Why choose JMP for linear regression? JMP, a statistical software package from SAS, is known for its interactive visualizations and user-friendly interface. Unlike other statistical software that require extensive coding, JMP allows you to perform linear regression with point-and-click functionality. This makes it an excellent choice for beginners while still offering the power and flexibility needed for advanced analysis.

## Course Modules in Detail

Letâ€™s delve deeper into the key modules covered in this free linear regression in JMP course:

### Module 1: Introduction to Linear Regression Fundamentals

This module lays the groundwork for understanding the theory behind linear regression. You'll learn about:

*   **Dependent and Independent Variables:** Identifying the variable you're trying to predict (dependent) and the variables you're using to predict it (independent).
*   **The Regression Equation:** Understanding the mathematical representation of the linear relationship between variables (y = mx + b, extended to multiple variables).
*   **Assumptions of Linear Regression:** Learning about the key assumptions, such as linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. Understanding these assumptions is crucial for ensuring the validity of your results.

### Module 2: Getting Started with JMP for Linear Regression

This module will guide you through the process of setting up JMP and preparing your data for analysis. Topics covered include:

*   **Importing Data:** Learning how to import data from various sources, such as Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and databases.
*   **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Cleaning your data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Transforming variables if necessary to meet the assumptions of linear regression.
*   **Exploring Data:** Using JMP's data visualization tools to explore your data, identify potential relationships, and check for outliers.

### Module 3: Performing Simple Linear Regression in JMP

This module focuses on performing simple linear regression with one independent variable. You'll learn how to:

*   **Fit the Regression Model:** Using JMP's "Fit Model" platform to fit a simple linear regression model.
*   **Interpret Regression Coefficients:** Understanding the meaning of the intercept and slope coefficients in the regression equation.
*   **Evaluate Model Fit:** Assessing the goodness of fit of the model using R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and the standard error of the estimate.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Performing hypothesis tests to determine the significance of the regression coefficients.

### Module 4: Mastering Multiple Linear Regression in JMP

This module delves into multiple linear regression, where you have multiple independent variables. You'll learn how to:

*   **Build Multiple Regression Models:** Creating regression models with multiple independent variables using JMP's "Fit Model" platform.
*   **Handle Multicollinearity:** Identifying and addressing multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) to avoid unstable coefficient estimates.
*   **Variable Selection:** Using techniques like stepwise regression and best subsets regression to select the most important independent variables for your model.

### Module 5: Ensuring Model Validity: Regression Diagnostics

This module is crucial for ensuring the reliability of your regression results. You'll learn how to:

*   **Assess Linearity:** Checking if the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
*   **Check for Independence of Errors:** Assessing whether the errors (residuals) are independent of each other.
*   **Evaluate Homoscedasticity:** Determining if the variance of the errors is constant across all values of the independent variables.
*   **Test for Normality of Residuals:** Checking if the residuals are normally distributed.
*   **Identify Outliers and Influential Points:** Detecting and handling outliers and influential points that can disproportionately affect the regression results.

### Module 6: Interpreting and Presenting Regression Results

This module focuses on understanding and communicating your findings effectively. You'll learn how to:

*   **Interpret P-values and Confidence Intervals:** Understanding the meaning of p-values and confidence intervals for the regression coefficients.
*   **Calculate and Interpret R-squared:** Interpreting R-squared as the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.
*   **Create Visualizations:** Generating informative graphs and charts in JMP to present your regression results effectively.
*   **Write a Results Summary:** Summarizing your findings in a clear and concise manner.

### Module 7: Predicting with Your Regression Model

This module shows you how to use your regression model to make predictions. You'll learn how to:

*   **Create Prediction Equations:** Using the estimated regression coefficients to create prediction equations.
*   **Calculate Predicted Values:** Using the prediction equations to calculate predicted values of the dependent variable for new values of the independent variables.
*   **Assess Prediction Accuracy:** Evaluating the accuracy of your predictions using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
