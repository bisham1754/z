## Getting Started with Leather Making: Essential Tools and Materials

Before diving into the video course, it's important to understand the basic tools and materials you'll need. Starting with quality tools will not only make the learning process easier but also ensure the longevity of your creations.

### Essential Tools:

*   **Stitching Tools:**
